# FixHorizontalFlip
Apply a horizontal flip to items that were flipped in a Premiere project and later imported to After Effects

1. Download this whole folder and put it in the same location as all your other extensions. (Should be something like `/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions`.)
2. Run the Premiere script first. It should appear in Premiere's extensions menu as "Add Markers."
3. Save the Premiere project.
4. Import it into AE. 
5. Run the AE script (fixMirror.jsx), which you can find in this same project, under AE/jsx.
